# PRD — Homepage Design (Scents by Sara)

Design the homepage for **Scents by Sara**, a premium body-shape scented candle brand rooted in scent science, female empowerment, and wellness rituals.

This homepage must look and feel like a calm, editorial luxury ecommerce experience inspired by:

- Aesop  
- Jo Malone  
- Neom  

Launch target: **March 2026**  
Audience: wellness-focused, design-conscious women aged **20–50**

---

# ✅ Brand System Reference (Required)

All design and UI decisions must strictly follow:

➡️ **brand-guidelines.md**

This includes:

- Typography rules  
- Colour palette usage  
- Button styling (radius 0)  
- Layout grid system  
- Iconography rules  
- Hero photography direction  

No component should deviate from these guidelines.

---
## Superseding Layout Directives (Authoritative)

These directives supersede all previous layout instructions in this PRD and other project docs wherever conflicts exist.

0. All screenshots in `references/sections/` are captured from the `1920px` design baseline.  
   All other breakpoints must be responsive adaptations of this baseline.
1. Add `1920px` as the wide desktop layout breakpoint.
2. For viewports above `1920px`, the page behaves as a boxed layout.
3. The layout is section-based. Each section behaves as a row.
4. Each section has a default design width of `1920px`, while still supporting `width: 100%`.
6. Default container width is `1800px` with `60px` left and right margins inside the section.
7. `.container-full` is a full-width container (`100%`) with no side margins.

---

## Overall Aesthetic

- Clean, minimalist luxury layout with generous whitespace.
- Calm, slow, sensory feel — never loud or overly commercial.
- Warm neutral backgrounds (avoid pure white).
- Base palette must use the official brand tones:

  - `#F9F6F2` (Soft Cream background)
  - `#E8E4DD` (Warm Light Grey sections)
  - `#CFC6B9` (Borders/dividers)
  - `#3F3229` (Primary text)
  - `#2D2B27` (CTA buttons)

See **brand-guidelines.md → Colour System**.

---

## Typography (Strict)

Typography must match the brand system:

### Headlines
- RL Limo Regular (serif)
- Used for hero titles, section headings, ritual statements

### Body + UI
- Suisse Intl Regular (sans-serif)
- Used for navigation, labels, product cards, buttons

See **brand-guidelines.md → Typography System**.

---

## Layout Rules

- `1920px` is the primary desktop reference breakpoint.
- Use section rows as structural layout units.
- Each section must support `width: 100%` with a `1920px` design baseline.
- Default content container:
  - width: `1800px`
  - side margins: `60px` each (inside a `1920px` section)
- For viewport widths above `1920px`, keep content boxed and centered.
- Use `.container-full` for intentionally full-bleed content with no side margins.

Whitespace and spacing are core to the brand.

See **brand-guidelines.md → Layout & Grid**.
